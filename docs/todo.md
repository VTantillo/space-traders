## Notes

- Seems like the most important thing is going to be getting the navigation
  right. Especially bc you have to have ships in a lot of places.
- Eventually will want some sort of service that can query the API for me.
- Also will probably want to store the system data, at least the basic location
  and stuff so that I can see the map and do fun animations and stuff.
- Good way to make money is by finding good trade routes between markets with
  compatible imports and exports.
- Apparently prices can fluctuate based on the number of agents selling stuff
